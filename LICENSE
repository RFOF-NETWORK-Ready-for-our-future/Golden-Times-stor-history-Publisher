Golden Times License 2026
Copyright (c) 2026 RFOF-NETWORK

Preamble
This license governs the use, modification, distribution, and publication of the
software and documentation contained in the Golden Times · Stor · History · Publisher
repository. It is intentionally concise, practical, and tailored to the project's
goals: open distribution, clear attribution, and release-bound licensing traceability.

Definitions
- "Software" means the source code, documentation, assets, scripts, styles,
  configuration files, and other materials contained in this repository.
- "Release" means a versioned publication of the Software associated with a
  Git tag (e.g., v0.1.0) and the corresponding GitHub Release entry.
- "You" means any person or entity that obtains a copy of the Software.

Grant of Rights
1. Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
   of the Software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use,
   copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of
   the Software, subject to the conditions below.

Conditions
2. Attribution
   - Redistributions of source code or binaries must retain the above copyright
     notice, this permission notice, and a reference to the originating repository:
     https://github.com/RFOF/Golden-Times-stor-history-Publisher
   - When publishing a packaged release derived from this Software, include a
     clear reference to the original repository and the Release tag or commit SHA
     that served as the basis for the published package.

3. Release Traceability
   - Any public redistribution that is presented as a "release" or "package"
     must include the Release tag (e.g., v0.1.0) and the `release-log.json` or
     equivalent metadata that documents the commit SHA and license hash at the
     time of release. This ensures reproducibility and legal traceability.

4. No External Dependencies Mandate
   - Distributions that claim compatibility with the Golden Times project must
     not require external, proprietary, or third-party services for core
     functionality unless explicitly documented and consented by RFOF-NETWORK.
     (This clause preserves the project's principle of self-contained operation.)

5. No Trademark Grant
   - This license does not grant any rights to use the "Golden Times", "RFOF",
     "GT-P", or related marks and logos for endorsement, advertising, or
     branding without explicit written permission from RFOF-NETWORK.

6. Patent and Contribution
   - Contributors grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
     license to any patents necessarily infringed by their contributions to the
     Software, solely to the extent required to exercise the rights granted by
     this license.
   - Contributions submitted to the repository are considered licensed under
     the same terms as this license unless otherwise stated.

7. Warranty Disclaimer
   - THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
     IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

8. Limitation of Liability
   - IN NO EVENT SHALL RFOF-NETWORK OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
     DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR
     OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE
     USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

9. Commercial Use and Redistribution
   - Commercial redistribution is permitted under this license provided the
     conditions above are met (attribution, release traceability, and no
     trademark use). For alternative licensing or commercial agreements,
     contact RFOF-NETWORK.

10. Jurisdiction and Interpretation
    - This license is intended to be interpreted in a manner consistent with
      open-source distribution practices. If any provision is found invalid or
      unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
    - This license does not replace professional legal advice. For binding legal
      arrangements or enterprise licensing, consult legal counsel.

Practical Notes for Maintainers and Users
- The CI workflow generates `release-log.json` and computes a license hash at
  release time. Keep `LICENSE` in the repository root and update it only when
  you intend to change licensing terms for future releases.
- When preparing a release, ensure `release-log.json` and `metadata.json` are
  included as release assets to preserve provenance.
- The "No External Dependencies Mandate" reflects the project's design principle:
  prefer self-contained assets and avoid hidden runtime dependencies that would
  undermine reproducibility.
